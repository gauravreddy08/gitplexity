Navigating large codebases can be overwhelming, whether you're trying to understand a package, debug a product, or steal someone else’s work off GitHub. 

This challenge often leaves *developers feeling lost*, especially newcomers to a project. 

When I joined my previous company, I faced the same hurdles-deciphering a massive codebase with minimal guidance, all while hesitating to interrupt busy senior colleagues.

> Enter **GitPlexity: *Perplexity for GitHub***
> 
> **GitPlexity** is your intelligent guide for seamless navigation of GitHub repositories. It transforms the way you explore codebases, helping you save time and gain clarity.

## **How GitPlexity Changes the Game**

### **Repository Input**

Users simply provide the GitHub repository they want to explore.

### **Interactive Codebase Mapping**

Behind the scenes, **GitPlexity** uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system to map the entire codebase into an intuitive, tree-like structure. This structure offers a clearer, more navigable alternative to GitHub’s native interface.

The app uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to create a tree-like structure of your repository. This map provides an overview of the codebase at a glance, so you can easily locate and access specific files.

### **LLM-Powered Chat**

* **File Insights:** Clicking on any file (a node in the tree) triggers an explanation from the LLM assistant. You’ll receive a brief description of the file and its role in the codebase.
* **Chat Interaction:** A separate chat tab enables you to query the LLM directly about the codebase for deeper insights.

## **Why GitPlexity?**
* **Ease of Navigation:** Instantly visualize the codebase structure, making exploration intuitive.
* **AI-Powered Guidance:** Understand files and their roles without needing constant help from teammates.
* **Developer-Friendly:** Perfect for onboarding, debugging, or simply learning how complex projects work.
